# Neural-Networks

Predict the burned area of the forest using Neural networks  The dataset contains 15039 instances of 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from a gas turbine. 

The Dataset includes gas turbine parameters (such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge pressure) in addition to the ambient variables. 
We need to predict turbine energy yield (TEY) using ambient variables as features.
